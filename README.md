lua-love-snow-particles
=======================

lua/love example that has a particle emitter in it that works

the main thing that stumped me was the area spread parameters did not make a lot of sense. I ended up needing to look at the source to figure out it was a string (at least it works, still not sure that is exactly correct).

most of the code is copied from other places and I just somehow got it to work.
